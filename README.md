# Valorant Trigger ![logo](icon.png)
A trigger with a very high reaction rate

## About
- it works really fast: 1000 scans per second
- Now works only with red enemies
- You don't need python to run, there is a compiled .exe version
- The executable file can be found in the Releases tab

## Usage
1. Assign an alternative shot key in the game, also specify the same button in `config.yaml`
For example, if you have identified the alternative button for the shot as "p", then we leave in the config: `shot_key: 'p'`
2. select a convenient button for triggering the trigger and assign it to. For example: `trigger_key: 'shift'`
3. the trigger will only be triggered when the trigger_key is pressed
4. Also, you can set a delay time before the shot and a pause after
5. to close the application, simply select the appropriate field in the tray


## Can I be banned?
Yes, of course they can, any software you use is at your own risk

## Why did I release this?
There have been a lot of cheaters in the game lately, I hope that the release of such software will give the developer more information about cheats so that they can handle it.

## Can I use this cheat?
Yes, you can, but please don't do it, let's not spoil the game
